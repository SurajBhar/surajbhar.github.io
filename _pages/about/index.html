Alongside building intelligent web tools and applications, I also craft insightful data visualizations and write interactive, engaging articles to make complex ideas more accessible and understandable.</p> <p>I received my M.Sc. in Mechatronics from Universität Siegen, where I completed my master’s thesis under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Michael Möller</a> and <a href="https://jovitalukasik.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Jovita Lukasik</a>. My dissertation, titled <strong>Improved Driver Distraction Detection Using Self-Supervised Learning</strong>, was supported by the research institute <em>Fraunhofer IOSB</em>, where I worked part-time as a Research Assistant. In this role, I contributed to the Human-AI Interaction department under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en/press/press-releases/2024/human-ai-interaction-new-department-focus.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr.-Ing.

David Lerch</a>.</p> <p>During my time at <a href="https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fraunhofer IOSB</a>, I collaborated closely with developers and researchers on cutting-edge AI initiatives under the <a href="https://karli-projekt.de/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">KARLI</a> and <a href="https://projekt-salsa.de/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SALSA</a> projects. I have worked on developing intelligent AI systems that combine large language models with retrieval-based architectures (e.g., RAG + RAPTOR) to enable scalable, context-aware information access. My experience also includes leading high-impact technical demonstrations, where I translated complex machine learning solutions into real-world applications for diverse stakeholders including researchers, industry leaders, and public sector officials.</p> </body></html>
