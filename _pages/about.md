I design and develop machine learning models and applications that empower people to **understand the real-world impact of AI** and data-driven systems. Alongside building intelligent web tools and applications, I also craft insightful data visualizations and write interactive, engaging articles to make complex ideas more accessible and understandable.

I received my M.Sc. in Mechatronics from Universität Siegen, where I completed my master’s thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Michael Möller](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/) and [Dr. Jovita Lukasik](https://jovitalukasik.github.io/). My dissertation, titled **Improved Driver Distraction Detection Using Self-Supervised Learning**, was supported by the research institute *Fraunhofer IOSB*, where I worked part-time as a Research Assistant. In this role, I contributed to the Human-AI Interaction department under the supervision of [Dr.-Ing. Michael Voit](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en/press/press-releases/2024/human-ai-interaction-new-department-focus.html), [Dr.-Ing. Frederik Diederichs](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/de/projekte-produkte/integrated-autonomous-driving-lab.html), and [M.Sc. David Lerch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=de&hl=de&user=BDOfyn8AAAAJ).
